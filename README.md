# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to provide insight into how crude oil production has changed in Europe and Russia since the beginning of the Ukraine war.

In order to provide this insight, the project aims to answer four business questions:

1. To what degree have European producers filled the gap since the start of the war?
2. How much of Russian crude production has been shut down compared to redirected?
3. Has European production increased exports?
4. Have European countries adjusted to importing more crude or refined products?

## Context

This project analyses two datasets: one from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and one from Eurostat. Combined, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of changes in crude oil production across Western Eurasia since the beginning of the Ukraine war.

## API Key Setup (EIA)

This project uses the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API.

You must provide your own API key.

You can obtain an API key from: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/

### Linux / macOS
```bash
export EIA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
